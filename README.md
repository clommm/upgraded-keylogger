🔐 **Title:** Enhanced Keylogger with Backspace Support (Exe Version)

📝 **Description:**
This Python script 🐍, built using the pynput library, offers enhanced keylogging capabilities with real-time monitoring. It captures keyboard inputs, including alphanumeric characters, special keys, and modifiers, and logs them into a dynamically updating log file named "log.txt", which is located in the `dist` directory if you executed the file using the .exe version. 💻📄 The script is packaged as an executable (.exe) file, facilitating easy deployment on Windows systems without requiring Python installation. Backspace support allows for the removal of the last character from the recorded keys. While not as advanced as some keyloggers, it provides a straightforward and effective solution for monitoring keyboard activity in real-time. 🔍🚀

🔒 **Privacy & Security:**
It's crucial to use this script responsibly and ethically, ensuring compliance with privacy and security regulations. Unauthorized use to capture sensitive information without proper consent is illegal and unethical. Always obtain permission before monitoring keyboard activity on any device. 🚫👀

🛠️ **Customization:**
While this keylogger does not offer advanced features, it can be customized and extended to suit specific requirements. Users can explore additional functionalities such as encryption or remote monitoring for more comprehensive keylogging solutions. 💡🔒

📣 **Warning:**
Before deploying this keylogger, ensure that you have the necessary authorization and legal permissions. Misuse of keylogging software can lead to severe legal consequences. Use with caution and respect the privacy of others. 🚨🔑

📂 **Executable Location:**
After running the PyInstaller command, the generated executable file can be found in the `dist` directory within your script's directory.

Would appreciate a ⭐ very much!:D
